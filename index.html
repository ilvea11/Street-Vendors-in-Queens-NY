				<p class="intro"> <span class="location"> Queens, New York — </span> Roosevelt Avenue in Queens is known for its vibrant and multicultural atmosphere, running from Flushing to Woodside, and is known for its diverse shops, restaurants, and a big number of street vendors. This area reflects the rich immigrant heritage of the neighborhood, whose population are mostly from Mexico, Central and Latin America. This makes the avenue a complete and unique experience for those who visit the avenue. 
				</p>
				 <p>
				In October a call was made by residents and community leaders of the neighborhoods to clean up the famous avenue. Mayor Eric Adams <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/760-24/mayor-adams-councilmember-moya-launch-multi-agency-operation-address-urgent-public-safety-and#/0"> announced </a> the initiative called, "Operation Restore Roosevelt." The operation started right away to clean up the unlicensed street vendors, prostitution, illegal brothels and other problems. New York State Governor, Kathy Hochul deployed state patrols to assist the NYPD and other agencies. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Mathew Nagler, professor of social economy and industrial organizations at the CUNY Graduate Center, said that the administration of Mayor Eric Adams is capable of effectively cracking down on those unlicensed vendors. The suppliers are going to benefit. "Licensed people are going to like this initiative because they're going to see an increase in their customer base, they're going to be able to charge higher prices, sell more stuff."
				</p>
				<p>
				But according to the stats obtained from NYC OpenData, licensed vendors have historically received more tickets than unlicensed vendors. The data found that unlicensed street vendors did not become a target until September of 2023. While licensed street vendors have been receiving tickets while having their licensed and permits in order.

				“The impact of the initiative on street vendors who use this means to support their families will be shocking”, said Flaviana Linares, who has lived in Corona for more than 25 years. She says that the New York City Police Department needs to focus on the real crime in the area, not the street vendors. "If there is a need for the people to sell on the street, then the people will sell food, fruit or vegetables, they will take the risk.
				</p>
				<p>
				The waiting list for licenses and permits for street vendors contains more than 9,000 people as of October 2023, this according to the report of the Independent New York City <a href="https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/fiscal-impact-of-eliminating-street-vendor-permit-caps-in-new-york-city-january-2024_Spanish.pdf"> budget </a>office. In 2021, the City Council passed a law called <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/business/food-operators/mobile-and-temporary-food-vendors.page#:~:text=Supervisory%20License,to%20apply%20for%20these%20permits."> Local Law 18 </a> which is expected to expand the licensing and permitting pathway for street vendors. 
				</p>
				<p>
				“The solution is not to fill up Roosevelt Avenue with policemen, the solution is to figure out how to increase the number of permits that are being given to them [unlicensed vendors]. Instead of giving a certain amount out, they need to triple the number of licenses given each year,” concluded Flaviana Linares.
				</p>
				<p>
				New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) is required to issue 445 new licenses and permits each year for the next 10 years. Since there is a long waiting period, a waiting list is created along the way. When there is availability, people receive an email telling them that they are the next one on the list to acquire their permit or license. In some cases there are people who proceed to obtain <a href="https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/Fiscal_Impact_of_Eliminating_Street_Vendor_Permit_Caps_Jan2024.pdf"> illigal permits </a> and licenses, which could cost them up to $17,000, according to the Independent Budget Office's (IBO) analysis. 
				</p>
				<p> 
				New York City News Service reached out to DOHMH's office for comment but no response was obtained.

				 <p>
				 Maria Rosales [whose name, NYC News Service had to change for fear of retaliation] is a street vendor, who has been in the field for seventeen years. She said sometimes it might be better not to have a license and permit since they [NYPD and DSNY] know who to keep an eye on.
				</p>
			    <p>
			    The data shows that since the initiative was announced in October of this year tickets have been given more now than before by the NYPD and the Sanitation Department. A few of the reasons written on tickets for licensed vendorsrange from for not displaying prices, failure to provide shed where required, failure to display permit or license documentation, failure to post grade pending card, and other reasons that have caused them to stress more about getting tickets.
			    </p>
			    <p>
			    	“They know those who don’t have licenses could provide a fake name and get away with it. For people like us with licenses and permits we have a harder time since they know that we must pay our tickets to keep our record clean to renew in a timely manner. This is all about money, the city wants more money,” said Rosales. 
			    </p>
			    <p>
			    	According to the Street Vendor Project’s <a href="https://www.streetvendor.org/history"> website </a> street vendors contribute to the economy of their local communities and throughout the city by paying $71.2 million dollars in local, state, and federal taxes.
			    </p>
			     <p>
			     	For years, vendors have protested the low number of permits, calling on the city to grant more permits. Many of whom are migrants and contribute to their communities in many ways. These vendors resort to street vending as their only source of income. "Our people sell typical food from our countries, and because of it people are buying it. It reminds them of back home,” concluded Rosales.
			     </p>
			     <p>
			     In November, ballot proposal number 2 was <a href="https://enr.boenyc.gov/OF10069CY0PY0.html"> voted </a> yes by nearly 62% of New Yorkers, giving the Department of Sanitation more power to target these vulnerable communities with the enforcement authority of vending. 
			  </p>

               In an interview with <a href="https://citylimits.org/2024/11/05/amid-street-vendor-crackdown-nyc-voters-weigh-enforcement-expansion/"> CityLimits </a>, Carina Kaufman-Gutierrez, the deputy director of the Street Vendor Project, said that the ballot proposal number 2 intentionally used misleading language to hide the real impact. “We’ve seen time and again that these crackdowns on vendors are violent, unjust, and do nothing to solve the root issues of economic inequality in our city.”
